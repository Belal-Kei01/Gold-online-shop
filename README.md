This is a demo project for a gold shop that wants to display, sell, and buy gold online.
The project demonstrates my skills in design and UI/UX.
I used a free API to fetch real-time gold prices and store the data in a database.
The system updates automatically and shows the current price to users while they are connected to the internet.
